 <!-- 3 ways to use css with our doc:
    1. embed the CSS within a <style> tag 
    2. inline styling within another element (this will override a overall style tag)
    3. link a stylesheet to our html document-->

  <!-- <style> 
      body {
          background-color: antiquewhite;
      }
  </style> -->

<!-- <body style="background-color: darkolivegreen;"> this is inline styling and this will take precedence over he general style tag  -->
